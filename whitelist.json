    "description": "The purpose of this channel is the diffusion of sacred music. The members of the Catholic ensemble HARPA DEI are four siblings, both in blood and in spirit, who try to gather the richness of the musical expressions that have arisen in different peoples as a response to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ to this world. Most of the pieces are traditional liturgical songs, presented in the original language in which they were composed. May the richness and variety of the sacred songs invite the listener to enter into contact with the Spirit of God and thus enjoy the beauty and goodness of our Lord!",
